First off, this is my second time buying the product and you guessed it, it's good enough that I will buy it a third time if need be!Upon unboxing we are greeted by the presence of 3 pair of extra ear buds . There is also a pair of ear fins in the packet containing the extra ear buds, these ear fins are used to keep the ear buds snugly in your ears during strenuous periods of use where there is a chance of lots of movement. More on this later.Coming to the ear phones itself, it's among the very few ear phones that genuinely feels premium in hand. It is very durable, specially the plug part that connects to your phone, many a time my ear phones stop working because the plug part malfunctions and causes problems in the functioning of the ear phones. This is not the case with these.The wire itself is made of rubber/silicon. It feels good in hand and the only thing I can think of that could be improved here is to braid the wire but so far the wire hasn't showed any form of wear and tear common with most other ear phone wires. Another thing to emphasize is that the entire cable is flat through out, this genuinely decreases the number of instances where I find myself trying to untangle the wire. This is truly one of the best features of this pair of earphones.Remember I said something about the ear phones being made completely of metal? Well it continues to the mic and the left and right splitter. Both these pieces feel very premium because of the signature cold feeling of metal against skin. I don't know about you but attention to small details like this always brings smiles to my face. It is to be noted that the mic piece is a universal single button type and hence cannot control volume, personally this problem didn't affect me much but the might be potential buyers who might find this to be a deal breaker.Mic quality is subject to individual bias therefore I can tell you my personal experience. In my opinion I feel that the quality is average, it won't blow anyone's mind but it will deliver most of the time. A common complaint I heard from most of my callers that they find it difficult to hear me when there is a significant amount of back ground noise or wind rustling in to the mic, these are common issues even with ear phones price significantly higher than the boAt BassHeads 152Finally the most important part of the review, the sound quality of the ear phones. As I said earlier I won't be going into the technical details . I am a bass lover and that is what led me to buy this pair in the first place. In my opinion I found that the Bass is indeed good but not over powering for the average consumer like how the Extra bass versions of the Sony line up of earphones trend to be. The volume gets sufficiently high and more often than not I use it at less than half it's total volume when listening to music. The clarity of the boAt BassHeads 152 are above par and easily betters even ear phones in the 2000 INR price category this is one other reason why I love this pair so much. A point to remember, as the entire covering of the ear phones is made of metal it is significantly heavier than other ear phones. This becomes a double edged sword, on the one hand the metal makes the ear phones feel very premium but it also makes it significantly heavier than other earphones made of plastic. This causes it to easily fall out of your ears if the supplied fins are not used. The find unlike the ones find in let's say the newer Bose ear phones aren't as comfortable and can hurt your ears if used over a prolonged time.Last but not the least, there are multiple color variants of the boAt BassHeads 152 including red, black and blue. I found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be a personal opinion but I find it to be the best of the three. That said I do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is a neutral color. This leaves out the red, for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at a lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales, therefore if you are short on cash and just want a great pair of ear phones then grab these while they last.Pros:1) No metal build2) Excellent wire quality and trendy3) Durable4) Above average sound qualityCons:1) Metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily2) Supplied Fins are uncomfortable to wear over a prolonged time3) Supplied Clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easilyI hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the BassHeads 220. All suggestions are welcome.Thanking you, Dwarakesh"

I think I am eligible to write this review. I received it on 21 October and today is 29 October and the battery is still at 50%. I know it's crazyyyyyzzyy. I regret why I didn't bought it sooner. Doesn't have heavenly sound like 50k headphones but it's has Nuclear generated Battery. which you will need to charge only 4to5 times a month.Bike rideIt's not ideal for bike riding, it's for indoor use, alot of wind noise when riding, but no wind noise when plugged inside the helmet, additionally it makes alot of noise when you touch the earphone wire, the noise is not from the speaker btwbatteryBattery is great, no question about it. It's been 8 day's, I use it everyday and carry it everywhere and still it has 50% battery. after 8 days continuous used.Sound loudnessThe sound is loud I Don't recommend anyone to use it more than 80% level unless you want to lose your hearing within a year. 40% sound level satisfy me. It's too loud. If you put it more than 80% it's too dangerous for the eardrum.lastingI Don't expect to last it more than 1 year, like every boat earphone i have bought previously. ( they can last only 1 year maximum which is kind of disappointing.)  it's like boat earphone are built to last exactly 1 years. which makes you buy again and again. Which of course  makes sense. if they build a earphone that last forever. they won't be able to sell their newly launched product anymore.lookit looks good when you put it around the neck without listening. but when you put it in your ear it doesn't look cool ( around public) if you want to look cool this is not the right choice for you üòÅCan connect 2 blutooth device at the same timeBut the problem is, it can't recognise which is yours and which isn't, so when someone near you turn on their bluetooth, it will directly connect to it. which is kind of a minor problem. but i suppose boat apps can fixed it.sound qualitysound quality is kind of in the middle, I Don't have complains, but it's far better than 500 rs wired earphone IMO. the bass has high beat sound. mids and treble are perfect for me, bass is too much for me, IDK About your opinion.Noise block (ANC)If you play music to 30-40% sound level, you won't hear anyone talking near you. but if you Don't play any music, the noise level is blocked around 10% i would say. Considering this doesn't have any ANC it's great.i will update after 1,2,3 months used."

I've been using them for a while, and here's my honest take on what they have to offer.Connectivity & Ease of Use:Let‚Äôs start with one of the essentials‚Äîconnectivity. The OnePlus Bullets Z2 nails it with seamless Bluetooth connectivity that just works. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as it gets, and once connected, they stay that way without any annoying drops. The button placement on the neckband is intuitive, and after a day or two of use, I could easily control playback without needing to glance down, thanks to muscle memory. It‚Äôs the kind of convenience you don‚Äôt realize you need until you have it.Sound Quality - Balanced Yet Personal:Now, onto the sound quality. As someone who values a balanced sound signature, I found the Z2 to be a great match for my taste. Whether I'm listening to some mellow jazz, electronic beats, or even rock, the sound remains well-rounded and crisp. The highs, mids, and lows don't overpower each other, making it perfect for those who don't want their ears blasted with bass or overwhelmed by treble.That said, sound quality is a subjective experience, and preferences can vary widely. If you're a bass head looking for those earth-shaking lows, you might find these a tad restrained. But if, like me, you appreciate a balanced output across genres, these will hit the right notes for you.Battery Life & Quick Charging - A Week of Peace:Battery life is another highlight. With moderate use‚Äîthink about 1-2 hours daily‚Äîyou can stretch a single charge to last an entire week. Even if you‚Äôre a heavy listener, using them for 6-8 hours straight, they can hold up for around 2-3 days before needing a recharge. And the quick charge feature is a lifesaver‚Äîjust 10 minutes of charging gets you 2-4 hours of extra playtime, which is perfect for those ‚Äúoops, I forgot to charge them‚Äù moments.Gaming & Low Latency - Smooth Experience:I spend a fair bit of time playing games like BGMI, and the low latency mode on the Bullets Z2 makes a noticeable difference. There's minimal lag between the visuals and the audio, which makes for a much more immersive gaming experience. It's not just about the sound being clear; it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.Comfort & Passive Noise Isolation:Comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the Z2 doesn‚Äôt disappoint. They come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. While there‚Äôs no active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. This makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.App Experience & Annoying Blinking Light:Now, onto a couple of quirks. The Bullets Z2 uses the HeyMelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. However, my unit just wouldn‚Äôt connect with the app, which was a bummer. So, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and I had to rely solely on the default Bluetooth pairing. While everything worked smoothly once connected, I feel like I missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.Another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you‚Äôre using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. Plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. A simple option to turn this off in the app would‚Äôve been a nice touch.Final Thoughts - A Solid Pick for Most, with Room for Improvement:Overall, the OnePlus Z2 delivers where it matters‚Äîgood sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won‚Äôt have you constantly reaching for the charger. It‚Äôs not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. Plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it‚Äôs hard not to appreciate the value you get.If you‚Äôre looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 is definitely worth considering. It might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point."
